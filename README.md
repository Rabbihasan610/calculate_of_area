# 📐 Calculate of Area

This repository demonstrates how to calculate the **area of geometric shapes** using different programming languages:  
- C 

It includes implementations for the following shapes:  
- Circle  
- Rectangle  
- Triangle  
- Square  
- Trapezoid  
- Ellipse

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The program shows a **menu of shapes**.  
2. The user selects a shape (1–6).  
3. The program asks for the **required inputs** (radius, base, height, etc.).  
4. The respective **function** is called to calculate the area.  
5. The **result is displayed**.

👉 Do you want me to also **add a table comparing syntax differences** between all these languages (like how each defines PI, functions, input/output)? That would make the README more educational.
